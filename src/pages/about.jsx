        <p>
          We’re a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu company founded by two practitioners who
          recognize the grind, the obsession, and the years it takes to truly
          master the art. In a sport where earning a black belt often requires a
          decade or more of dedication, we believe that level of skill, insight,
          and experience deserves more opportunities to be valued.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe hard work should pay off. Today, there are few paths
          for practitioners to earn compensation from their skillet and
          knowledge, often limited to running a gym, producing instructionals,
          or winning world championships. We set out to change that. Our
          platform allows experienced practitioners to connect directly with
          students by reviewing match or training footage and delivering
          personalized, tailored feedback. It’s a new way for experts to share
          what they know, and a more direct way for students to get guidance
          that actually applies to their game.
        </p>
        <p>
          At our core, we want to help techniques spread, learning accelerate,
          and the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu continue to grow. By connecting
          practitioners across experience levels, we’re building a community
          where knowledge moves freely, expertise is rewarded, and everyone gets
          better on the mats.
